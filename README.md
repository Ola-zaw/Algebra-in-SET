This repository contains all project files used and created by the team consisting of Martyna Sadowska and [Aleksandra Zawadka](https://github.com/Ola-zaw), in connection with our project in the course 'Algebra in Data Science' at Warsaw University of Technology, during the 2023/2024 summer semester.
In our project, we analyse algebra from geometry in the card game SET.

In 'SET_1.py', you can generate and visualise a random set. In 'SET_2.py', you can generate a random set plane, which can be used for playing SET. In 'SET_3.py', you can see every possible card used in the game.

For further description and analysis see 'Project_Description.pdf'.
